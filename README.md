# Computer_Graphics_mini_project
OpenGL is software that provides a graphical interface. It is an interface between the application program and the graphics hardware. Simulation of Living Room involves the implementation of several objects that can be placed in a living room, such as a television, cabinet, sofa, slab, window, roof and floor mat. There are separate userdefined functions for each of the objects to be drawn. These are initially made as functions and defined separately. One function named draw is used and each objectâ€™s function is being called in this function draw. This draw function is being called in the display function. Also in the television, there is an animation used that is the clouds are moving continuously. There is an introduction path that initially has the title of the project. Later if the user presses on the key C/c then another window is displayed and that is the living room. The views of the living room for the viewer are left , right , top and bottom. This can be done by the user using keys a, d, w and s respectively.
